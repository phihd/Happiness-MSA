# Happiness-MSA
The final project for the course Multivariate Statistical Analysis

## Introduction 

First publised in 2012, the World Happiness Report measures the state of happiness through specific indicators. The report has gained attentions from governments and many global organizations and become
effective assessment criteria of a nationâ€™s development. As an data analysis enthusiast in Finland, I am
curious about underlying components inducing the fact that Finland is the happiest country in the world.
In this report, the lastest version of data published in 2019 is utilized to analyze the relationships among
attributes.

## Research question  
This project aims to propose detail answers for the following questions:  
1. How different attributes correlated to each other?  
2. How could the variance in the data be performed with fewer components? What does this new performance
tell?  
3. Is it possible to have an unsupervised clustering method for this data?
